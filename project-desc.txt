⭐ THE PERFECT PROJECT FOR YOU
🔥 A Stateful Layer-7 Deep Packet Inspection Firewall + Traffic Analyzer (C++17/20, OOP, Real Packets)

This is basically a mini Suricata / Snort + mini Wireshark + mini Nginx proxy, all in one — but scoped so you can finish it.

This hits every single system skill:

raw sockets

libpcap

threading (std::thread)

lock-free queues / ring buffers

parsing binary protocols

memory management (RAII)

design patterns (Visitor, Factory, Strategy, etc.)

modular C++ architecture

connection tracking

state machines

performance tuning

security features

real packet handling + live network monitoring

And NO big external dependencies except pcap.

This is a senior-level systems project. Legit.
